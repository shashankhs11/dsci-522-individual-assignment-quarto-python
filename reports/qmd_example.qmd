# Aim

This project explores the historical population of horses in Canada 
between 1906 and 1972 for each province.

# Data

Horse population data were sourced from the Government of Canada's Open Data website [@horses1;@horses2]

# Methods

The Python programming language [@Python]
and the following Python packages were used to perform the analysis: 
pandas [@pandas], altair [@altair], click [@click], 
as well as Quarto [@Allaire_Quarto_2022]. 
*Note: this report is adapted from @ttimbers-horses.* 

# Results

![Horse populations for all provinces in Canada from 1906 - 1972.](../results/horse_pops_plot.png){#fig-horse-pop}

We can see from @fig-horse-pop that Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta 
have had the highest horse populations in Canada. 
All provinces have had a decline in horse populations since 1940. 
This is likely due to the rebound of the Canadian automotive industry 
after the Great Depression and the Second World War. 
An interesting follow-up visualisation would be car sales per year 
for each Province over the time period visualised above 
to further support this hypothesis.

Suppose we were interested in looking in more closely at the province 
with the highest spread (in terms of standard deviation) of horse populations. 
We present the standard deviations in @tbl-standard-dev.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-standard-dev
#| tbl-cap: Standard deviation of historical (1906-1972) horse populations for each Canadian province.
horses_sd_table = pd.read_csv("../results/horses_sd.csv")
largest_sd = horses_sd_table['Province'].values[0]
Markdown(horses_sd_table.to_markdown(index = False))
```

Note that we define standard deviation (of a sample) (@eq-standard-dev) as

$$s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \overline{x})^2}{N-1} }$$ {#eq-standard-dev}

Additionally, note that in @tbl-standard-dev we consider the sample standard deviation of the number of horses during the same time span as @fig-horse-pop.

![Horse populations for the province with the largest standard deviation](../results/horse_pops_plot_largest_sd.png){#fig-horse-dev width=65%}

In @fig-horse-dev we zoom in and look at the province of `{python} largest_sd`, which had the largest spread of values in terms of standard deviation.
